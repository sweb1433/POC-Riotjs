# POC-Riotjs
```
Super simple riot examples 
```


###Installation
```
-install bower   1."npm install bower".
-install riot    2."bower install riot" in the project directory.
-install http server.
-run "http-server" and open localhost:8080.
navigate to localhost:8080 to see conditional rendering.

```
```
-Conditional Rendering:
-go to tbh tag in index2.html and delete the text written in error part.
-after deleting , the div part will not be rendered and not be visible to localhost:8080/index2.
-this is because the length of error message is set to 0.
-this is conditional rendering.
```
